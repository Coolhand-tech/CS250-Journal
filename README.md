I interpret user needs by communicating with the client early and often to understand their goals, and then translating those goals into clear, actionable user stories. Creating user stories helps break down large needs into specific tasks, making it easier to design features that meet user expectations.

I approach developing programs by starting small, building incrementally, and constantly seeking feedback. Agile processes like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives help keep the team aligned and adaptable. In the future, I hope to continue using these Agile practices to stay flexible and collaborative in my development work.

Being a good team member means communicating openly, supporting others, being adaptable to changes, and staying committed to shared goals. It also means respecting every role on the team — from developers to testers to scrum masters — because each plays a vital part in delivering a successful product.
